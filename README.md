A copy of our Vex High Stakes. This code uses specific vex functions to control a drivtrain, and also use data from sensors for our drive PID and turn PID. We are most proud of our PID code, which you can see in Autom.cpp. Our pid code has 3 variables our proportional, integral, derivative, which represent 3 unique things. We input our desired position in inches then our code will use these 3 variables to shrink the error and stop as it approaches the error.
